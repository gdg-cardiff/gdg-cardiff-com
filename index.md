# Google Developers Group Cardiff

We are GDG Cardiff, Cardiff’s Google Developer Group 

Our mission is to connect developers and local enterprises with great resources to help them get creative with code.

We believe Google offers some of the best resources you’ll find - great tools, learning materials and support for developing apps, crunching data and building cool stuff.

We aim to use those resources to create opportunities in Cardiff to learn together, build things together and, who knows, maybe even change the world together.

### Activities
Tune in for our [I/O Extended Event](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-cardiff-presents-google-io-extended-cardiff/) on May 24th. 

We'll be announcing our schedule of events for 2021.
